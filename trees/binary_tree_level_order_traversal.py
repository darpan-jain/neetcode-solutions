    Approach: Use iterative BFS, since it is 'level' order (BFS -> breadth == level)
    Remember DFS is for Depth-First traversal/search!
    
    Time complexity: O(N) since we do a BFS on the tree.
    Space complexity: O(N), since the queue stores upto N/2 nodes in it. 
    This makes O(N/2) -> O(N) space complexity
