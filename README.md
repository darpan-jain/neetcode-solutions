# Neetcode Solutions + Explanations

## What is this repo?

This is a list of 150 solutions (in progress) for the list by [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/practice). The solutions are in Python3 and contain intuitive explanations for each code block.

## How to use this repo?
- I recommend using the solutions here as a pointer for your interview preparation for Software Engineering roles. 
- I would recommend you try to solve the questions on your own first and then refer to the solutions here. This will help you understand the concepts better.
- You can find the list of questions that are covered in this repo [here](questions_list.md)

_Pro tip_: Try to explain the approach to another person or to yourself (out loud). You'd be surprised how much you learn by doing this!

## How to contribute?

- If you have a better solution to any of the questions, please feel free to open a PR. 
- I will review it and merge it if it is better than the current solution. 
- Please do remember to add a neat explanation for your solution with the time and space complexities.
